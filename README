Screencalc is an Android application for calculating parameters for a
display screen: width, height, diagonal, pixel density, aspect
ratio. Given any of these, it will try to calculate the
rest. Combinations which will work are:
     * any 2 of (aspect, diagonal, height, width) plus any 1 of
       (density, heightpx, widthpx)
     * aspect + density + (heightpx or widthpx)
     * all 3 of (density, heightpx, widthpx)
Discrepancies are not checked if you overspecify.
