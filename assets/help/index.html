<H1>Help Page for the Screencalc App</H1>
<P>Screencalc lets you calculate various parameters of a display screen, namely its
dimensions in distance units, dimensions in pixels, pixel density and optimal viewing
distance. Given a suitable subset of these parameters, it is able to work out all the others.
<P>For example, given the diagonal measurement and the aspect ratio, it is able
to work out the width and height. Given the number of pixels along one dimension
as well, it can tell you the number of pixels along the other dimension, together
with the pixel density (number of pixels per unit distance) and viewing distance.
<P>To use Screencalc, fill in whatever information you know, and tap the “Calculate”
button. Fields that it can determine, and ones that were validly entered, will be displayed
in <SPAN CLASS="valid_field">green</SPAN>; if any field that was left empty cannot be
worked out from the ones that were entered, it will remain with its
<SPAN CLASS="entry_field">yellow</SPAN> background, and a brief message will appear.
If any input was invalid (e.g. not a valid number or not using recognized units), it
will be displayed with a <SPAN CLASS="error_field">red</SPAN> background.
<P>To start afresh, use the “Clear All” button to clear all the fields. Alternatively,
you can tap the

each calculated field to clear just that field.
<P><B>Uniform Pixel Densities Only:</B> Screencalc assumes that the vertical
and horizontal pixel densities are always the same. This is true of all current
computer/smartphone/tablet displays and digital television sets.
<H3>Cut/Copy/Paste</H3>
<P>You can long-tap any <SPAN CLASS="entry_field">editable</SPAN> field to cut or
copy its contents, or paste its contents from the Android Clipboard. You can
long-tap any <SPAN CLASS="valid_field">calculated/validated</SPAN> field and copy its contents
to the Clipboard.

<H2>Distance Units</H2>
<P>Screencalc can perform its calculations in either centimetres or inches, as
specified by the Default Units radio buttons at the top of the display.
Input numbers are interpreted in the current default units if none are specified;
alternatively, you can append the appropriate units suffix (“cm” or “in” for
distances, “dpcm” or “dpi” for pixel density) to a number to override the current
default units. Calculated fields will always be explicitly shown with the
applicable units, except for the height and width in pixels, which are always
in pixels regardless.
<H3>Converting Units</H3>
<P>To convert measures from one unit to the other, simply change the default
units, then, <I>without reentering any data</I>, tap the “Calculate” button.
All measures already input or calculated will be recalculated in the new units.

<H2>Aspect Ratios</H2>
<P>The <I>aspect ratio</I> is the ratio of the height of the screen to its width.
This is usually expressed as the ratio of two integers separated by a colon,
<I>h</I>:<I>w</I>. The autocomplete for this field includes various common
aspect ratios, such as 9:16, 3:4 etc. Alternatively, you can enter a real
number (like “0.75”) or even a ratio of reals (like “1:2.35”) and it will
work out a suitable approximate integer ratio representation.
<P>Note that the height comes first in the ratio, not the width.

<H2>View Distance</H2>
<P>The “View Dist” field shows the estimated optimal viewing distance for
the display, based on the ability of the typical human eye to resolve individual
pixels. The usual basis for calculating this figure is to assume that the
eye can just resolve one pixel per arc-minute, or alternatively 60 pixels per
degree of angle. However, Screencalc measures the angular distance between
pixels diagonally, rather than vertically or horizontally as other programs might
do. Thus, you will see a factor of &#x221a;2 &#x2245; 1.4 discrepancy between
the numbers reported by Screencalc versus other programs: basically, Screencalc reports
about a 40%% greater viewing distance for the same pixel density, or conversely,
about a 40%% greater pixel density for the same viewing distance.

<H2>More Complex Example: Equivalent Diagonals</H2>
<P>Screencalc can help with more complex calculations.
For example, given parameters for a screen with one aspect ratio, what are the parameters
for a screen with another aspect ratio but the same height and pixel density?
<P>To be more specific, say you have a widescreen (9:16 aspect) monitor with 1080×1920
pixels and a 24-inch (61-cm) diagonal. What would be the diagonal for an extra-wide
9:21 aspect monitor with the same height?
<P>First, enter the parameters for the 9:16 monitor and tap “Calculate”. All the fields
should now be filled in. Next, clear just the width distance,
width in pixels, diagonal distance, and aspect ratio fields. Enter the new aspect
ratio of 9:21. Then press “Calculate”, and you will see the fields you cleared get
recalculated for the new monitor. It should show a diagonal of almost exactly 76cm, or 30in,
and a width of 2520 pixels. It will also reduce the 9:21 ratio to its lowest terms, 3:7.
